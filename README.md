# Turbulence-Text-Dataset

This is the repository for the datasets used in our ECCV 2022 paper Single Frame Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation: A Benchmark Study and A New Physics-Inspired Transformer Model. 

The Turbulence Text Dataset can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWvQfPM-lJwGqK_Wm6lDbi-tYBu-Uopq/view?usp=sharing

The Heat Chamber Dataset can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14iVachB95bCCtke8ONPD9CCH20JO75v2/view?usp=sharing

This dataset was also used in the 5th UG2+ Prize Challenge in associated with the "Bridging the Gap Between Computational Photography and Visual Recognition Workshop" at CVPR 2022. http://cvpr2022.ug2challenge.org/
